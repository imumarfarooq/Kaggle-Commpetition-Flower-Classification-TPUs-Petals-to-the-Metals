# Kaggle-Commpetition-Flower-Classification-TPUs-Petals-to-the-Metals
Welcome to the Petals to the Metal competition! In this competition, youâ€™re challenged to build a machine learning model to classify 104 types of flowers based on their images. In this tutorial notebook, you'll learn how to build an image classifier in Keras and train it on a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At the end, you'll have a complete project you can build off of with ideas of your own.
